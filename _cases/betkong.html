			<p>Betkong is an international eSports bet exchange that's currently under development. We were approached to put together early UI and UX concepts for Betkong in Sketch.</p>

			<p>Good design helps a brand exude trustworthiness and put people at ease, which is especially important when a) breaking into a market and b) money is involved. Our approach was to marry great design with familiar gaming elements and an information structure that users would be familiar with.</p>
