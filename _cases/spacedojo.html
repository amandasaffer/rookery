			<p>Josh Owens is a Javascript developer, entrepreneur, and teacher. Previously an active member of the Rails community, he moved to Meteor and started Meteor Club&mdash;a place for people to learn and network with fellow devs. He's since expanded to include other Javascript technologies, and Spacedojo was born.</p>

			<p>The Rookery has worked with Josh to design and develop fresh but consistent materials as his brand evolves&mdash;including design and development for classes, landing pages, podcasts, events, and more.</p>
