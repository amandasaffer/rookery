		<h4 class="title">Background</h4>
		<p>Josh Owens is a developer, entrepreneur, and teacher in Javascript community. He's also the proprietor of <a href="https://crater.io/" target="_blank">Crater.io</a>, a news aggregator for real-time development. Previously an active member of the Rails community, he moved to Meteor and started Meteor Club&mdash;a place for people to learn and network with fellow devs. He's since expanded to include other Javascript technologies, and Spacedojo was born.</p>

		<p>My work with Josh has been to design and develop fresh but consistent materials as his brand evolves&mdash;including design and development for classes, landing pages, podcasts, events, and more.</p>
