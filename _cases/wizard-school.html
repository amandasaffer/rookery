		<p>Wizard School, the first card game from DFTBA Games, raised over <a href="#" target="_blank">$450,000 on Kickstarter</a>, so there was considerable interest and excitement surrounding the game. But between the co-founders and illustrator, there was no designer on the team to design the actual cards.</p>

		<p>I worked with DFTBA Games to create new card designs that kept the game's spirit while making gameplay easy to understand. The cards had to do justice for the illustrations (by Karen Hallion) while maintaining information hierarchy and legibility. There were also conditions from retail stores to keep in mind.</p>
