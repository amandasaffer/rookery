			<p>Wizard School, the first card game from DFTBA Games, raised over <a href="#" target="_blank">$450,000 on Kickstarter</a>, so there was considerable interest and excitement surrounding the game. But between the co-founders and illustrator, there was no designer on the team to design the actual cards.</p>

			<p><strong>Card Design:</strong> We worked with DFTBA Games to create new card designs that keep the game's spirit while making gameplay easy to understand. We wanted to do justice to the illustrations (by Karen Hallion) while maintaining information hierarchy and legibility.</p>
