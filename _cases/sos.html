		<p>At Solving Organ Shortage I was a jack of all trades. As the sole creative at a bootstrapped nonprofit, I was in charge of everything from design and development of web and print materials to videography and photography at scientific summits. My experience at SOS taught me how to get things done, even when I thought I didn't have the time, skill or resources to deliver.</p>
