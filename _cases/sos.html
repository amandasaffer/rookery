            <p>Before The Rookery, Amanda worked at SOS full time as a jack of all trades. As the sole creative at a bootstrapped nonprofit, she was in charge of everything from design and development of web and print materials to videography and photography.</p>

            <p><strong>Event Management and Design</strong>: Amanda designed print collateral and presentations for scientific summits and also served as a technical director for over 20 scientists per event. This included everything from troubleshooting IT issues to conducting video interviews with researchers.</p>

            <p><strong>Building an Online Community</strong>: At the beginning of her involvement with SOS, Amanda was solely a designer who worked with HTML, CSS and JQuery. In order to put together an online community of scientists, Amanda learned Meteor and advanced Javascript in 3 months. She applied these skills to build a full back-end member management system and CMS for the SOS website.</p>
