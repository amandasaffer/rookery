		<p>At Solving Organ Shortage, Amanda was a jack of all trades. As the sole creative at a bootstrapped nonprofit, she was in charge of everything from design and development of web and print materials to videography and photography at scientific summits. Her experience at SOS taught her how to get things done, even when she thought she didn't have the time, skill or resources to deliver. She brings these lessons to her work at The Rookery.</p>
