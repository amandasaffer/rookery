            <p>The Internet Creators Guild is a non-profit organization that exists to further the industry of online content creation. The ICG is supported by dues from members which helps fund case studies, podcasts, and other resources.</p>

            <p><strong>Brand &amp; Identity</strong> The Rookery worked with ICG to create an identity that would define the community from day one. We didn't want the logo to look too modern, so we married the idea of internet creation with a throwback to print publications.</p>

            <p><strong>Web Development</strong> We put together the ICG website with Laravel, which allowed us to easily integrate with Stripe to accept subscription payments and Socialite to allow members to link their social media accounts to their membership. The ICG gained over 400 paying members within the first month of launch.</p>
