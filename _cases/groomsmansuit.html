            <p>Jeanne and Diana approached The Rookery to put together a custom Shopify theme to sell their amazing groomsmen suits. Renting a tux or suit can cost groomsmen over $200, and they still have to return it the next day! The Groomsman Suit knew there had to be a better way, so they started selling high-quality suits at an affordable price (that you get to keep after the wedding!)</p>

            <p><strong>Design &amp; Development:</strong> We put together a custom Shopify theme for TGS that keeps the focus on the suits: the featured image is from a real wedding and every product has a hover animation that shows two views of each suit. And because ordering online can be difficult, we built a custom sizing calculator and helped install third-party applications to manage the many variants of each suit.</p>
