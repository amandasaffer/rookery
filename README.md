# The Rookery
The Rookery's website and blog built with Jekyll, Susy, and SCSS.



### Installing Jekyll

First, make sure you have [RubyGems][ruby-gems] installed. Then run `gem install jekyll` in your Terminal.



### Running a Server

You can just run `jekyll serve` to run a server, but in order to test the site on local devices with a local IP address, you'll need to run `jekyll serve --host 0.0.0.0` instead.

[ruby-gems]: https://rubygems.org/pages/download
